## Machine Learning explainability

The adoption of AI systems in regulated domains requires trust, which can be built by providing reliable explanations of the behavior of trained models and how the deployed models make predictions. Model explainability may be particularly important to certain industries with reliability, safety, and compliance requirements, such as financial services, human resources, healthcare, and automated transportation. To take a common financial example, lending applications that incorporate the use of ML models might need to provide explanations about how those models made certain predictions to internal teams of loan officers, customer service representatives, and forecasters, in addition to end users/customers.
