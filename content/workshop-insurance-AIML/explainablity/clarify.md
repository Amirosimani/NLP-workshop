Amazon SageMaker Clarify helps improve your machine learning (ML) models by detecting potential bias and helping explain the predictions that models make. It helps you identify various types of bias in pretraining data and in posttraining that can emerge during model training or when the model is in production. SageMaker Clarify helps explain how these models make predictions using a feature attribution approach. It also monitors inferences models make in production for bias or feature attribution drift. The fairness and explainability functionality provided by SageMaker Clarify provides components that help AWS customers build less biased and more understandable machine learning models. It also provides tools to help you generate model governance reports that you can use to inform risk and compliance teams, and external regulators.
