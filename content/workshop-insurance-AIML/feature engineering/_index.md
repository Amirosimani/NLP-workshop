## Pre-processing

With Amazon SageMaker Processing jobs, you can leverage a simplified, managed experience to run data pre- or post-processing and model evaluation workloads on the Amazon SageMaker platform.

A processing job downloads input from Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), then uploads outputs to Amazon S3 during or after the processing job.
