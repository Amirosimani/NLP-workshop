## AI Services

In addition to sageMaker, AWS provides dedicated AI Services which can be used for specific tasks, or integrate as part of a larger model.

In this section we review two of a common text processing services

* [Amazon Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/) - extracting printed text, handwriting, and data from virtually any document
* [Amazon Comprehend](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/) - NLP(natural-language processing) Service which provides text analysis and insights  


Both services use Machine Learning under the hood, but we can use and integrate them simply by calling the service with the desired arguments.

Let's review the services and demonstrate common use cases for each one.
