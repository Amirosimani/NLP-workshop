### Step Function

This notebook describes how to use the AWS Step Functions Data Science SDK to create a machine learning model retraining workflow. The Step Functions SDK is an open source library that allows data scientists to easily create and execute machine learning workflows using AWS Step Functions and Amazon SageMaker.

Let's open our notebook and begin the lab:

1. Access the notebook instance you created earlier.
2. On the left sidebar, click the Folder icon and navigate into the `MLAI-workshop-resources/mlops/automate_model_retraining_workflow/` folder. Double-click on `automate_model_retraining_workflow.ipynb` to open it.
3. You are now ready to begin the notebook. Follow through the provided steps to build your custom container, and then leverage it for training in SageMaker.
