### Pipeline
Amazon SageMaker Pipelines is the first purpose-built, easy-to-use continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service for machine learning (ML). With SageMaker Pipelines, you can create, automate, and manage end-to-end ML workflows at scale.

Orchestrating workflows across each step of the machine learning process (e.g. exploring and preparing data, experimenting with different algorithms and parameters, training and tuning models, and deploying models to production) can take months of coding.
