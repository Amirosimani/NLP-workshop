## AutoPilot Demo

Amazon SageMaker Autopilot automatically trains and tunes the best machine learning models for classification or regression, based on your data while allowing to maintain full control and visibility. With SageMaker Autopilot, you provide a tabular dataset and select the target column to predict, which can be a number (such as a house price, called regression), or a category (such as spam/not spam, called classification). SageMaker Autopilot chooses the right algorithm, automatically tunes the hyperparameters of the chosen algorithm, and provides a leaderboard of recommended models with an automatically generated notebook that you can edit and reuse. You then can directly deploy the model to production with just one click, or iterate on the recommended solutions with Amazon SageMaker Studio to further improve the model quality.
