## Amazon Sagemaker MLops

Data Scientists and ML developers need more than a Jupyter notebook to create a ML model, to test it, to put it into production and to integrate it with a portal and/or a basic web/mobile application, in a reliable and flexible way.

MLOps is a concept that can help you:

1. To quickly deploy a change that you make in your codes for example
2. To build a repeatable and reliable ML workflow
3. To track all the steps you have taken and keep the lineage of ML workflow

 Amazon SageMaker Pipelines is purpose-built, easy-to-use continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service for machine learning (ML). With SageMaker Pipelines, you can create, automate, and manage end-to-end ML workflows at scale.
