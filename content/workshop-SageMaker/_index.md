## Machine Learning using SageMaker

Amazon SageMaker makes it easy to train machine learning (ML) models by providing everything you need to tune and debug models and execute training experiments. After you choose the right algorithms and frameworks from the wide range of choices available, it manages all of the underlying infrastructure to train your model at petabyte scale, and deploy it to production.

In this workshop you will learn how to use __Amazon SageMaker__ to train your models including:

* How to train a model using an algorithm provided by Amazon SageMaker
* How to use your custom code (script) to train a model on Amazon SageMaker
* How to bring your own custom algorithms as containers to run on SageMaker
* How to track, evaluate, and organize training experiments
* How to distribute your training job
* How to tune your model
* How to get full visibility into the training process through Amazon SageMaker Debugger
