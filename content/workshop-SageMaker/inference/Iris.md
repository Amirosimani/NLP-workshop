### SageMaker Inference

This tutorial shows you how to use Scikit-learn with Sagemaker by utilizing the pre-built container. Scikit-learn is a popular Python machine learning framework. It includes a number of different algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and data/feature pre-processing.

Let's open our notebook and begin the lab:

1. Access the notebook instance you created earlier.
2. On the left sidebar, click the Folder icon and navigate into the `MLAI-workshop-resources/inference/scikit_learn_iris_endpoint_batch_transform` folder. Double-click on `scikit_learn_endpoin_batch_transform.ipynb` to open it.
3. You are now ready to begin the notebook. Follow through the provided steps to build your custom container, and then leverage it for training in SageMaker.
